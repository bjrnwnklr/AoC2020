# Day 11, part 2

How many different configurations can the adapters be arranged?

Ex1 has 8 different ways.
Ex2 has 19208 different ways.

Expected: a trillion. What is the most efficient way to count configurations?

[0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 19, 22]

Recursive approach:
1) build a bi-directional graph
2) each leave (end point) has value 1
3) each node's value is the sum of the values of child nodes
3) use recursion to add up sum of value of successors (incl memoization, either by using global dictionary or Python's `functools` `@lruc_cache`

1 (all 1)
+ 2 (for 2 additional ones with neighbors of 4)
+ 1 (for 1 additional with neighbors of 5)
+ 1 (for 1 additional with neighbors of 10)

1 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 8?

1^x + 3^1 + 2^2 = 8

# Dynamic programming approach

Start from 0 and keep count of possible paths to each child node. We don't even have to do this explicitely for each child node, we can just iterate through the whole list as valid child nodes are the ones with distance of 3.

```python
paths_to = defaultdict(int, {0: 1})
all_adapters_sorted = sorted(adapters)

for a in all_adapters_sorted:
    paths_to[a] = paths_to[a - 1] + paths_to[a - 2] + paths_to[a - 3]

print(f'Part 2, dp: {paths_to[all_adapters_sorted[-1]]}')
```
