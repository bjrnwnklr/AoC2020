## Part 1
This was again a puzzle that could be solved in multiple ways. I implemented the following ways to solve and compared the execution time of the main solution algorithm (excluding the common parts like reading/parsing the data, compiling the regex and finding the matching messages).

| algorithm | execution time (ms) |
| --- | ---- |
| recursive | 0.00028659999999999797 |
| iterative | 0.044016599999999996 |
| dynamic | 0.0062656 |
