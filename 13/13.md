# Day 13, part 2

What is the earliest timestamp such that all the listed bus IDs depart at offsets matching their positions in the list?

Ignore the first line input.

Examples:
67,7,59,61  is 754018
67,x,7,59,61 is 779210
67,7,x,59,61 is 1261476

Expected result for our input is very large - so probably need a closed form.

the solution fulfills the following equations:

t = n1 * 67
t + 1 = n2 * 7
t + 2 = n3 * 59
t + 3 = n4 * 61

n4 = (t + 3) / 61
n3 = (t + 2) / 59
n2 = (t + 1) / 7

n2 = (n1 * 67) + 1 / 7

Chinese remainder theorem

t === 0 % 67
t === 6 % 7 (7 - 1)
t === 57 % 59 (59 - 2)
t === 58 % 61 (61 - 3)
