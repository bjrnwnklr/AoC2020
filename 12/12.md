# Day 12, part 2

- The waypoint is 10 units East and 1 unit north of the ship.
- The waypoint moves with the ship

N, S, E, W move the waypoint in that direction by the given value
L / R rotate the waypoint around the ship (L left / counter clockwise, R right / clockwise)
F moves forward to the waypoint a number of times equal to the value (e.g. if waypoint is 10 east 1 north, F1 moves the ship 10 east and 1 north; the waypoint moves with the ship)


R
wp R360 =       10n, 0e     (-10, 0)        10n, 1e     (-10, 1)    do nothing
R90 -- wp =     10e, 0s     (0, 10)         10e, 1s     (1, 10)     swap r / c, c *= -1
R180 -- wp =    10s, 0w     (10, 0)         10s, 1w     (10, -1)    r *= -1, c *= -1
R270 -- wp =    10w, 0n     (0, -10)        10w, 1n     (-1, -10)   swap r / c, r *= -1

WP = (r, c) relative to ship, i.e. 1 n, 10 e = (-1, 10)

rotation: 
- 90: swap r / c and mult -1
- 180: mult r and c * -1
- 270: swap r / c
