# Day 14, part 1

Changing bitwise:
- setting bits to 1: use OR (`|`) e.g. to set bit 1 to 1:

```python
val = 0b1001 # = 9
val |= 1 << 1 # val is now 0b1011 = 11
```

- setting bits to 0: use AND (`&`) with a inverted bitmask to set any bits that are 1 in the bitmask to 0

````python
val = 0b1011 # = 11
val &=~ 1 << 1 # val is now 0b1001 = 9
````

- Bitmasks can also be specified using binary notation:

````python
val = 11 # = 0b1011
val &=~ 0b10 # to set 1st bit to 0, val is now 9 = 0b1001
````
