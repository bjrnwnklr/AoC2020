# Day 14, part 1

Changing bitwise:
- setting bits to 1: use OR (`|`) e.g. to set bit 1 to 1:

```python
val = 0b1001 # = 9
val |= 1 << 1 # val is now 0b1011 = 11
```

- setting bits to 0: use AND (`&`) with a inverted bitmask to set any bits that are 1 in the bitmask to 0

````python
val = 0b1011 # = 11
val &=~ 1 << 1 # val is now 0b1001 = 9
````

- Bitmasks can also be specified using binary notation:

````python
val = 11 # = 0b1011
val &=~ 0b10 # to set 1st bit to 0, val is now 9 = 0b1001
````

# Day 14, part 2

Not values are modified by the bitmask, but the memory addresses:

- if bit is 0, the mem bit is unchanged
- if bit is 1, the mem bit is overwritten with 1
- if bit is X, the mem bit is floating, meaning it can have any value of 0 or 1 (e.g. one X causes 2 addresses to be written, two X cause 4 addresses to be written etc)

Use `itertools.product` to generate all combinations of 0/1 with the required length.

```python
from itertools import product

products = product([0, 1], repeat=3)
for p in products:
    pass # apply the product
```
