# Day 11, part 2

How many different configurations can the adapters be arranged?

Ex1 has 8 different ways.
Ex2 has 19208 different ways.

Expected: a trillion. What is the most efficient way to count configurations?

[0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 19, 22]

1) build a bi-directional graph
2) each leave (end point) has value 1
3) each node's value is the sum of the values of child nodes
3) traverse using stack from top down: sum of value of successors (incl memoization)

1 (all 1)
+ 2 (for 2 additional ones with neighbors of 4)
+ 1 (for 1 additional with neighbors of 5)
+ 1 (for 1 additional with neighbors of 10)

1 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 8?

1^x + 3^1 + 2^2 = 8
