This was so far the most interesting problem with many possible solutions.

The problem consisted of parsing lines of mathematical expressions and calculating the result. As a twist, the normal rules about operator precedence are slightly different, e.g. multiplication and addition have the same precendence (part 1), or addition has a higher precedence than multiplication (part 2).

## Ways to solve

### My intuitive solution

- Parse expression one character at a time
- Use an accumulator and "last operator" to store the result so far and the last operator
- Use pseudo-recursion with a stack to save previous state when encountering an opening parenthesis

### Recursion

Same as my solution, but instead of a stack (pseudo recursion), use real recursion

### Shunting-yard algorithm

Dijkstra's shunting-yard algorithm will process an infix expression and convert it into Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), which can then be processed easily.

### Building a parser using Lex/Yacc

We can build a standard parser using Lex (to define the tokens) and Yacc (to define the grammar).

This can be done using PLY (Python Lex-Yacc), see example code.
